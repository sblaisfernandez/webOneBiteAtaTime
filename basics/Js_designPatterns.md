# Learning Process

1. **Deconstructing** Define the JS patterns to cover.

The skills will be properly acquire when I will by able to explain the patterns with code to someone. The patterns need to be implement in a markdown including code and explaination.
  
  - Learning JS DP
  
  - Learning JS DP for Front End Architecture (Vue.js or React.js) 


2. **Self-Correct** Identify the Js Patterns to be learn and redefine the learning goal.

3. **Removing barier to learning**
  - have a clean desk
  - have a apple on the desk
  - have delicious chocolate bar on the desk
  - have water to the desk
  - have great chair, kweyboard, mouse, 2 monitors
  - have ritual of schedule learning time during the week

4. **Pre-commit** 
  - Do the research phase of 2-3 hrs.
  - Define in the commitment of 20 hrsis worted.
  - Put in place the scheduale to learn the next skill.
  - Evaluate what could interfer the success of the time frame. 
  - Have a ultimate goal to over at the end of the learning process and a reward.
  - Have multiple gaol and reward during the learning process.

# Learning JS Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solution to commonly occuring problems in software design.
Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.

The 23 gang og Four(GoF) patterns are generally consided the fondation for all other patterns.
DP are categorize has: Creational, Structural, Behavioral.

- Design Patterns: represents good practice.
- Anti-Patterns: bad practice. Ex: modifiy the `Object` clas prototype.

Js have multiple design Patterns(DP), they can be Front End, back End or Isomorphic JS (Universal JS).

## Categorization

- Creational DP
- Structural DP
- Behavioral DP
- Concurrency DP
- Architectural DP

### Creational DP

Creational patterns focus on ways to create objects of classes.

- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Structural 

Structural patterns focus on ways to manage relationships between object to make the application architecture scalable.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral DP

Behaviroral patterns focus on communication between objets.

- Chain of Resp.
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

### Concurrency DP

These DP deal with multi-threaded programming paradigms.

### Architectural DP

MVC, MVP, MVVM
