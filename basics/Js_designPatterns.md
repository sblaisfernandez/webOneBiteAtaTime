# Learning Process

1. **Deconstructing** Define the JS patterns to cover.

The skills will be properly acquire when I will by able to explain the patterns with code to someone. The patterns need to be implement in a markdown including code and explaination.


2. **Self-Correct** Identify the Js Patterns to be learn and redefine the learning goal.

3. **Removing barier to learning**
  - have a clean desk
  - have a apple on the desk
  - have delicious chocolate bar on the desk
  - have water to the desk
  - have great chair, kweyboard, mouse, 2 monitors
  - have ritual of schedule learning time during the week

4. **Pre-commit** 
  - Do the research phase of 2-3 hrs.
  - Define in the commitment of 20 hrsis worted.
  - Put in place the scheduale to learn the next skill.
  - Evaluate what could interfer the success of the time frame. 
  - Have a ultimate goal to over at the end of the learning process and a reward.
  - Have multiple gaol and reward during the learning process.

# Learning JS Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solution to commonly occuring problems in software design.

- Design Patterns: represents good practice.
- Anti-Patterns: bad practice. Ex: modifiy the `Object` clas prototype.

Js have multiple design Patterns(DP), they can be Front End, back End or Isomorphic JS (Universal JS).

## Categorization

- Creational DP
- Structural DP
- Behavioral DP
- Concurrency DP
- Architectural DP

### Creational DP

These patterns deal with Object creation.

- Module
- Prototype
- Observer
- Singleton
- Abstract

### Structural 

These patterns deal with  Object relationships.

### Behavioral DP

These types of DP recognize, implement, and improve communication between disparate Objects in system.

### Concurrency DP

These DP deal with multi-threaded programming  paradigms.

### Architectural DP

MVC, MVP, MVVM
